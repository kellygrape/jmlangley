            <p>When I first started with Jackie I was a very shy and unconfident performer, but thanks to her I have gained so much confidence in not only my voice but also my stage presence as a whole. I'm so glad I chose to work with Jackie!</p>

            <p>I started taking lessons from Jackie as a freshman in high school after I had her as a director in the show Seussical the Musical. She really helped stretch my range into a strong tenor as well as perfecting my musical theatre tone after a rigorous operreta-style singing focus. Jackie also significantly helped in my preparation for choral competitions and performances, such as PMEA, Haverford Chamber solos, in addition to local theatrical auditions for many organizations, such as PCS, UDPAC, and Merion Mercy.  Uniquely to her lessons, Jackie makes sure to take the time to give advice not only in singing, but auditioning details that are key factors in a student's development.</p>

            <p>I started taking voice lessons with Jackie Langley when I a junior in high school at a time in my life when I knew that I was passionate about theatre, but I had little to no confidence in my singing voice. A teacher at my school recommended Jackie to me and from Jackie's first email response I could tell that this was someone who cared deeply not just about theatre and music, but about her students as she immediately welcomed me with open arms...During lessons we not only focus on vocal technique but audition preparation, as she not only came up with lists of song options and spent the time to pick the perfect one for my voice, but also practiced reading sides to allow me to understand the characters I would be auditioning for. When it came time to audition for collage theatre programs last year, Jackie's advice and training gave me the boost I needed to be accepted into my number one choice.  Under Jackie's direction, I have grown confidence not only in my singing voice but also in myself as actress, performer, and individual.</p>

            <h3>Jordan Busza</h3>
            <p>When I first began with Jackie, I was extremely unsure and reserved in my capabilities as a singer/performer. I was unaware of how to properly use my voice to its full potential. But in a very short time, that quickly changed. After meeting Jackie for the first time, I realized that she was someone who not only cared for the theatre community and what it stands for, but also for the people who are a part of it. During lessons, Jackie works on building up song repertoire, breathing/vocal strength, acting abilities, and confidence during any audition you may face. And for me especially, being in lessons with her has a certain level of comfort that makes me feel right at home. In fact, time spent working or even just talking with Jackie seems to fly by so fast, and I feel like I barely just got started! Through many busy schedules, a few voice changes, and several major events, Jackie has helped me shape who I am as a performer and as a person. For the past three years, my experience with Jackie has been nothing but wonderful and enjoyable, and I am glad to say that it will continue to be for years to come.</p>

            <h3>Lauren Milewski</h3>
            <p>I started taking voice lessons with Jackie Langley because I had always loved singing, but I didn’t have enough control over my voice. I didn’t know how to project without my voice cracking, and I didn’t use many facial expressions when I would sing. I heard from several of my close friends that Jackie was an amazing voice teacher, so I decided to take a lesson. After a very short time, my voice improved tremendously. She taught me how to project, and every time she would give a new song, she would explain the show it was from as well as what the character would think during the song, which helped with my acting abilities for future auditions and shows I would try out for. She really is an amazing voice teacher, and I will always come back before auditions for another lesson! If you’re debating taking lessons with her, I would just go for one and see how you feel, because you’ll probably love it just like I did.</p>

            <h3>John Parkinson</h3>
            <p>I started taking voice lessons with Jackie in my sophomore year of high school. Since then, my performing abilities have improved profoundly thanks to her. Jackie makes sure that each student has a repertoire that is tailored to his or her voice, but that is also challenging and varied. Working with her on classical and modern musical theatre pieces has helped me to improve my singing and acting, prepare for auditions, and excel in my performances. Most importantly, Jackie truly cares about mentoring – something which can be seen in her passion and engagement for each student. I highly recommend lessons at Perfect Fifth Studios for anyone.</p>

            <p>I studied at Perfect Fifth Studios for three years. Jackie was exactly what I was looking for.  I had been singing improperly for years but Jackie was the only teacher who really helped me understand how to properly use my voice.  As a result of coming to Perfect Fifth Studios my voice is healthier and stronger. Working with Jackie was so easy because she cares so much about her students.  She knows about all of her students extracurricular activities and helps you to schedule around them so that there’s always time for voice lessons.  Jackie is always prepared with songs from any particular musical and other songs that sounded good for my voice months before an audition so that I feel as prepared as possible. If you’re on the fence about working with Jackie I strongly recommend her!</p>
